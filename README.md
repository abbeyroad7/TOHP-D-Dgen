# LootGen
A D&D Loot Generator with an emphasis on "Theater of the Mind" storytelling. Using AHK (Autohotkey) script, you can bind this utility to any hotkey of your choosing to overlay any Windows-based environment.

The script is built to pull a random line from multiple official and homebrew D&D loot tables. Using tag identifiers in the table, like {COLOR}, {RACE}, {BEAST} can further add variety in the responses to yield a unique response every time the generator is run.

#### Examples
