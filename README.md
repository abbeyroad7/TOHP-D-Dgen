# LootGen
A D&D Loot Generator with an emphasis on **"Theater of the Mind"** storytelling. Using AHK (Autohotkey) script, you can bind this utility to any hotkey of your choosing to overlay any Windows-based environment.

The script is built to randomly select a Prompt line from a loot table and swap out any present tag identifiers with a random line from a corresponding wordbank. Tag identifiers are read as {COLOR}, {RACE}, {BEAST} in the Table and can further add variety in the responses to yield a unique response every time the generator is run.

## Examples
{CONDITION} A tombstone  Reads 'Here lies {NAME}. Cause of death: {SUBJECT}'
